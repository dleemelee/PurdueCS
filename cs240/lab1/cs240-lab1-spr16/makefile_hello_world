# Makefile for Program 1 - Hello World 
# This makefile will compile lab1_hello_world.c using gcc 
# This makefile can be run using make command as follows
#    /cs240/lab1 $ make -f makefile_hello_world
#
# The command provided for the target 'all' is the 
# the exact same command that is entered in the command
# prompt to get the hello_world.out file
#
# By writing this into a makefile from now on all
# we have to just invoke 'make -f makefile_hello_world' instead
# of the gcc command. This does not seem like a huge improvement
# as of now. If you consider the case of compiling multiple 
# source/header files together into a single program, 
# the use of make clearly has advantages.

all:
	gcc -Wall -Werror -g lab1_hello_world.c -o hello_world.out

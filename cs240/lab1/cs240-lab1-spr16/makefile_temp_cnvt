# Makefile for 2nd program of Lab1 - Temperature conversion
#
# This program consists of 2 c files and 1 header file
# All the three files should be compiled together to get
# the executable output. The actual gcc command which will
# give us the desired output is 
#
#   /cs240/lab1 $ gcc lab1_temp_cnvt_main.c lab1_temp_cnvt_aux.c -o temp_cnvt.out
#
# We can observe that as the number of constituent source files (*.c)
# increase the gcc command to compile will grow longer
# Thus we use makefiles to put a one time effort to write the long 
# command and keep reusing it instead of typing it everytime.
# The make file for temp_cnvt can be written as follows.
#

CC=gcc

OPTIONS=-Wall -Werror -g

 * Constructor for the Employee

 * Remarks:
 *      The constructor is called to initialize the memory of the object.
 *      It should perform appropriate copies of strings, and initialize
 *      various member variables as required.

 * Parameters:
 *      other - Constant reference to another Manager instance that we are copying
 * Remarks:
 *      The copy constructor is called to create a new instance as a copy
 *      of an existing instance. Copies should be 'deep' meaning that any
 *      underlying resources such as memory should also be copied over.

 * Remarks:
 *      The destructor is called when an instance of the class is deleted,
 *      either by calling 'delete' on a pointer or when a local copy on the
 *      stack is deleted when a function returns. The destructor must cleanup
 *      any memory or resources held by the object.

/**
 * Copy assignment operator
 * Parameters:
 *      other - The other instance we are being assigned from
 * Returns:
 *      A reference to the current instance 'this' that was assigned to
 *      A copy assignment operator is invoked when an assignment is occuring,
 *      for instance Engineer a = b; where b is an existing Engineer instance.
 *      The operator should free any resources currently being held by the
 *      current instance 'this' and then copy over any resources from 'other'
 *      similar to how the copy constructor must create a full copy of all the
 *      resources and values inside the other instance being passed as a parameter

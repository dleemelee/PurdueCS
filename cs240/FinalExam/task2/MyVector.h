#include <iostream>

/*
  * ================================ TASK-2 ================================= *
  * The main() function performs various arithmetic operations on the objects *
  * of MyVector. But these operations are NOT yet defined in MyVector class.  *
  * The constructors and print() are defined in constructors.o                *

  * Your task is the following:                                               *
  * 1. Find out the various arithmetic operators to be overloaded             *
  * 2. Declare the operator-overloading function prototypes in the MyVector.h *
  * 3. Implement the operator overloading functions in MyVector_fxns.cpp      *
  * 4. Identify exception cases and throw objects of MyException class        *
  
  * ================================= HINT ================================== *
  * HINT1: Go through main() and testcases. Observe the compilation errors.   *
  * HINT2: You will define three operator overloading functions.              *
  
  * ================================ RULES ================================== *
  * RULES to keep in mind for TASK-2                                          *
  * RULE 1: Add your operator overloading function prototypes in              *
  *         MyVector.h file (this file)                                       *
  * RULE 2: Add your code in MyVector_fxns.cpp                                *
  * RULE 3: Make sure your code compiles using the Makefile provided.         *
  *         Compilation error will give you -NO POINTS-.                      *
  * ================================= END =================================== *

  * ================================ TASK-1 ================================  *
  * The MyVector class has prototypes for the following functions, but the    *
  * implementation of these are missing. The functions are                    *
  *   1. get_size                                                             *
  *   2. get_num_at_idx                                                       *  
  *   3. set_num_at_idx                                                       *
  * Your task is to implement these functions in MyVector_fxns.cpp file.      *
  * The rest of the functions and constructors are defined in constructors.o  *
  * NOTE: Use MyException wherever necessary.                                 *
  
  * Few RULES to keep in mind for TASK-1                                      *
  * RULE 1: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE                                           *
  * RULE 2: Add your code in MyVector_fxns.cpp                                *
  * RULE 3: Make sure your code compiles using the Makefile provided.         *
  *         Compilation error will give you no points.                        *
